👋 Hi! I'm Gábor Kazi, shortly Gábor or Gabor

👨‍💻 I study Computer Science Engineering at Széchenyi István University.

😅 Mostly I code in Python but I'm currently learning C++. My Python knowledge is, well, not that good. But that's my first languge.
   I'm in the early stages of learning. I make large and small projects for gaining experience.

📈 My current project is a life simulator game with a bunch of interesting mechanics.

🚀 For the future, I would like to be a software developer.
